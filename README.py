The original purpose of these scripts was to find out if there was a correlation between the length 
of a wikipedia plot summary for a film and the running time of that film. But then I thought It would be 
interesting to grab some other data while i was there as well.

Writing a script that webscrapes from wikipedia is likely to run into problems down the line since wikipedia
is constantly being edited.

Head to 'generate_graphs.py' to build a graph comparing two peices of movie data from the top 10 grossing films
of the last few decades. There are some quite interesting results!
